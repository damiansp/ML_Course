# ML_Course

The code here was developed in part as a student in the Coursera.com Machine Learning specialization offered by the University of 
Washington:
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning

I created this repository primarily as a record of the work I have done, as well as a means of backing it up.

Some of the work herein requires the Dato graphlab create module, though code is available for all alorithms implemented that may be run
independent of graphlab create.  For details see: https://dato.com/products/create/

Please feel free to refer to these materials as a tool to help in your own education, but please also adhere to the Coursera Code of 
Ethics if doing the course yourself.
